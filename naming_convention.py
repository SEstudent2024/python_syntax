# Python Naming Convention Practice
# Objective: The aim of this assignment is to understand and apply Python's naming conventions, 
# particularly for variables and constants.

# Task 1: Code Correction You have been given a piece of code with several variable and constant names 
# that don't follow the Python naming convention. Your task is to correct them:

# Pi_value = 3.14
PI_VALUE = 3.14    #constant

# userAge = 25
user_age = 25     #variable

user_location = "New York"    #variable

# MAXLIMIT = 1000
MAX_LIMIT = 1000     #constant
