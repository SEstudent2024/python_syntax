# Arithmetic Operations in Daily Life
# Objective: The aim of this assignment is to get familiarized with basic arithmetic operations and 
# understand how they can be applied in everyday situations.

# Task 1: Grocery Store Math Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, 
# given their individual prices. For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? 
# Prices don't need to be realistic!

bread = 4.50
peanut_butter = 3.25
jelly = 4.25

total_cost = bread + peanut_butter + jelly

print(f"The cost of bread, peanut butter and jelly will be ${total_cost} all together.")

# Task 2: Bank Interest If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly 
# interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after a year. So if you had $10,000 at a 7% 
# interest write code that would tell us the amount at the end of the year. For the example the expected 
# outcome would be $10,700.

initial_amount = 10000
interest_rate = 7 / 100

total_amount = initial_amount * (1 + interest_rate)

print(f"The total amount of savings in the bank account after one year will be ${total_amount}")
